### This repository has been deprecated, and replaced with https://github.com/SMARTRACTECHNOLOGY/gateway-os

Docker image that provides https://github.com/crohr/rpm-s3

WARNING: This is a publicly available image on https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcosmos/rpm-s3/[Docker Hub], and as such *no private information should be included in the images*.

== Usage

=== Local

Add `add-rpm.sh` to your path, for example:

[source, bash]
----
ln -sf ${PWD}/add-rpm.sh ~/bin/add-rpm
----

Now you can go into a folder with a freshly made RPM, and just run: `add-rpm beta *.rpm`

=== Jenkins

In your projects Jenkinsfile use it like this:

[source, groovy]
----
dir('target') { # <1>
  docker.image(rpmdevtools).inside {
    withAWSCredentials() { # <2>
      sh "/usr/local/bin/rpm-s3 -b repo.lifecycles.io --region \"us-east-1\" --visibility \"public-read\" -p \"linux/gateway/rpm/${ENV}/${arch}\" *.rpm"
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Move into the directory where the RPM file is.
<2> This is a Jenkins pipeline helper that provides the necessary `ENV` variables into the container.
